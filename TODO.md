# TODO StemmaWeb

* Re-implement front page (20220107)
  * Load info about a tradition
  * Show any stemmata as a place to start
* Variant graph editing (20220107)


# Probably Essential
* Paging through stemmata for a tradition (D3 style a must?)

# Essential or Nice to Have?
* Svg/div does not resize on viewport (browser window) resize. Solution unknown at the moment, requires testing and research (~8 hrs?)

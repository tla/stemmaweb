Stemmaweb - a Catalyst webservice for text tradition analysis
=============================================================

Stemmaweb is a web application, developed in Perl (using the Catalyst framework) and Javascript (using JQuery), for analysis of the copying relationships (stemmatology) between different manuscript versions of the same text.

Trying it out
------------
A `docker-compose.yml` file is included in this directory, which will launch Stemmaweb behind an nginx proxy listening on port 5000. It may be necessary to obtain your own development API keys for Google and reCAPTcha authentication, in order to create user accounts.

Installation
------------

To run Stemmaweb you need a working Perl installation (5.12 or above)
and, preferably, a working webserver. The following steps will get you
set up to run the standalone service:

* Ensure that the following software is installed (the list given is that of the relevant Ubuntu packages):
  * gcc
  * make
  * libxml2-dev
  * zlib1g-dev
  * libexpat1-dev
  * graphviz
  * libssl-dev
  * libgmp-dev
* Install the following Perl modules:
  * App::cpanminus
  * Module::Install::Catalyst
* Install the dependencies for Stemmaweb from this directory:

		cd /PATH/TO/stemmaweb && cpanm -S --installdeps .
* Make a test database (which relies on SQLite being installed) and test the installation at http://localhost:3000/ :

		script/maketestdb.pl
		script/stemmaweb_server.pl
* If you only want to test Stemmaweb, then you are done! Otherwise, create a database for the storage of text tradition data. This can be anything supported by Perl's DBI, so long as you have the database software and relevant DBD::* drivers installed.
* Replace the database settings in stemmaweb.conf with the settings for your database. If you are using MySQL, for example, the contents of the <Model Directory> stanza might look like this:

		<model_args>
		dsn dbi:mysql:dbname=stemmaweb;host=DB_HOSTNAME
		<extra_args>
			user STEMMAWEB_USER
			password STEMMAWEB_PASS
			<dbi_attrs>
				mysql_enable_utf8 1
			</dbi_attrs>
		</extra_args>
		</model_args>

* (Optionally) configure Stemmaweb to run under FastCGI, Starman, or any other Catalyst-compatible application framework. See http://www.catalystframework.org for more information. The provided stemmaweb.psgi was written to work with Starman running behind Apache on a specified non-root URL path.
